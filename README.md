#Connect Four
####The TURK edition

is a two-player game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves. This game was trademarked in 1974 by Milton Bradley and was a favorite during my childhood. "Pretty sneaky, sis" still lives on today(at least to me)


###Technologies used

This game was built with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.  It also uses a bit of the jQuery library for some of the DOM manipulation.

###Next steps
Coming soon in version 2.0

1. **Change the board** - use different size boards:    8 X 7, 8 X 8, the sky's the limit
2. **Game with an attitude** - nothing like a bit of smack talk to inspire your spirit of competition.
3. **Personalized game play** What good is smack talk if you don't get called out by name.
4. **Gravity** - We all know that discs don't appear out of nowhere.  In the next version, you can see them fall.
5. **Keep track** Keep a running score of wins in case you want to go pro.  This feature was requested by four time world champion Dave Dameshek
